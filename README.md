# Algorithmic-Trading-Paired-Stocks-Strategy

This project aims to create a strategy based on paired stocks and compare them with benchmarks. 
Pair trading strategy is categorized as statistical arbitrage, and it is when you match a long position with a short position in two pair stocks that have a high positive correlation.

I have taken companies that were similar using cointegration, and after the selection, I was able to build a strategy based on creating a Price Ratio signal between pairs.

Based on the previous results, the algorithm will then adjust the portfolio weight every day/week/month.
